okay so craps is a betting game 


- we'll be using a dice so obviously using the dice function 
- players make "bets" and then the dice rolls then whatever blah

/*
Craps
Roll 2d6 
If 7 or 11, player wins
Else if 2, 3, or 12 player loses 
Else, record the sums as the players point
Continue rolling until the player makes their "point" and wins or rolls a 7
*/

Write a program that plays 1000 games of craps. Seed the random number generator with 42. Use switch-case for the different rolls and enumeration for the game states . You will need to keep track of wins and losses and how many rolls until the game ended. Then, print out:

The chances of winning to 2 decimal places.

The average length of a game to 2 decimal places. Count the length of a game in the for-loop header.
