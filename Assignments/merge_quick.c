/*
Merge Sort Algorithm

Got an array 

Split until you get to single elements 

Merge Both elements and list until you get to end 

(You need two functions a merge sort function and a merge function)


so we kinda juggle A and B so that it just becomes sorted

mergesort(A)
{
    copy A into B (use memcopy)
    mergesort(B, A, length)
}

mergesort(A, B, length)
{
    if length is 1, return
    mergesort first half of A into first half of B 
        mergesort(A,B, length/2)
    mergesort second half of A into second half of B
        mergesort(A+length/2,B + ) 
    merge B into A
}


 

Quick Sort Algorithm 

Take a pivot (hopefully close to the pivot)

yeet all elements less than to the left and greater than to the right

keep goin till u good
