okay so craps is a betting game 


- we'll be using a dice so obviously using the dice function 
- players make "bets" and then the dice rolls then whatever blah

/*
Craps
Roll 2d6 
If 7 or 11, player wins
Else if 2, 3, or 12 player loses 
Else, record the sums as the players point
Continue rolling until the player makes their "point" and wins or rolls a 7
